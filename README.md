## Scrimba Vanlife Project

This project was built as part of the **Scrimba Learn React** course and represents a complete React application called **Vanlife** — a web app that lets users explore, filter, and view van listings for a “vanlife” rental experience.

It’s one of the final projects in the course and combines everything learned throughout the modules, including React fundamentals, hooks, routing, and API data management.

### 🧩 Project Overview

**Vanlife** is a React-based single-page application (SPA) created with **Vite**.  
It simulates a platform where users can:

- Browse a list of vans available for rent  
- Filter vans by type (simple, rugged, luxury, etc.)  
- View detailed information for each van  
- Navigate between pages like *Home*, *About*, and *Host Dashboard*  
- Use dynamic routing for individual van pages  
- Fetch and display data from a local API or mock server  

The app uses **React Router** for navigation, **hooks** for state management, and a simple **server.js** for serving van data.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** (with hooks and functional components)
- **React Router v6**
- **Vite** (for fast dev and build setup)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS** (custom styling)
- **Node.js / Express** (for local API server)
- **Fetch API** (for retrieving van data)

### 📚 What I Learned

Building this project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Setting up a React project using **Vite**
- Using **React Router** for navigation, nested routes, and dynamic URL parameters
- Fetching and displaying data from an API using **fetch()**
- Managing component state and side effects with **useState** and **useEffect**
- Filtering and mapping data arrays for dynamic rendering
- Handling loading and error states in the UI
- Passing data via **props** and using **state lifting**
- Structuring a React project with clear separation of components, pages, and utilities
- Serving mock data through a simple **Node/Express API**
- Creating a responsive and visually appealing layout
